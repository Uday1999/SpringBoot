The Expense System project's backend is crafted using Spring Boot, organized into four packages. The MODEL package contains the Expense.java model class.
The CONTROLLER package features the expanseController.java controller class. Within the SERVICE package, an interface and its implementation class are housed to manage the project's services.
The REPOSITORY package encapsulates the ExpenseRepo.class for handling repository operations. This structure ensures a modular and organized approach, facilitating efficient development
and maintenance of the Spring Boot-based Expense System backend.
